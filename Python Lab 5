# Desription: this program reads an unspecified number of integers, determines 
#how many positive and negative values have been read, and computes the 
#total and average of the input values (not counting zeros). Your program ends 
#with the input 0. Display the average as a floating-point number. 

#starting with initial counters
tol = 0
count = -1
pos = 0
neg = 0

#pront user to enter int or end if entered 0

#statment that adds to counters given the conditions
#if x is not 0 adds the positives if x is greater than 0, vice versa to negatives
if x != 0:
    count = 0

#if the conditions are not satisfied or 0 is entered, prints out positives,
#negataives, total, and the average of all numbers

# Desription: Write a program that displays, ten numbers per line, all the numbers from 
#100 to 200 that are divisible by 5 or 6, but not both. The numbers are 
#separated by exactly one space. 

#start with initial count
count = 0

#x is divisible by 5 but not 6
