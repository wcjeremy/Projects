# QUESTION ONE
# THIS PROGRAM removes all the occurrences of a specified string from a text 
# file.

#takes the file name from user
fileName = input("Enter a filename: ")
#takes a string that is wanted to be removed from the text file
remove = input("Enter the string to be removed: ") 

#open the given file
file = open(fileName) 
#creates a brand new file that is the given file with the removed string
newFile = open("Clear.txt", "w+")

x = [remove]

# this is look looks into the given file and replaces the
# word that needs to be removed with nothing
for i in file: 
    for word in x:
        i = i.replace(word, "")
    newFile.write(i)

file.close()
newFile.close()
#prints when operations are finished
print("Done")

# QUESTION TWO
# THIS program that will count the number of characters, words, and lines in a 
# file. Words are separated by a white space character. Your program should prompt 
# the user to enter a filename.

#asks user to input a file 
file = input("Enter a filename: ") 

#opens the file
fileOpen = open(file, "r+") 
#assign the words as variable data
data = fileOpen.read() 
#finding the amount of characters
numbChar = len(data) 
print(f"{numbChar} characters")

#initial counter
numWords = 0
# Words are separated by a white space character.
lines = data.split() 

#counts the non numeric words
for word in lines: 
    if not word.isnumeric():
       numWords += 1
print(f"{numWords} words")

#initial counter
numLines = 0
#spliting the data into lines
lstData = data.split("\n") 

#counts number of lines
for i in lstData:
    if i:
      numLines += 1
print(f"{numLines} lines")

# QUESTION ONE
# THIS program that writes 100 integers created randomly into a file. Integers are 
#separated by a space in the file. Read the data back from the file and display the 
# sorted data. Your program should prompt the user to enter a filename. If the file 
# already exists, do not override it. 


import random

file = input('Enter filename:')

with open(file, "w") as afile:
    print("The 100 random integers are: ")
    for i in range(100):
        line = str(random.randint(1,100))
        afile.write(line)
        print(line, "", end='')

print("\nDONE")
