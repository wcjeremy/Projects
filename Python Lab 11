# Description: This program Write a program that reads an unspecified number
# of integers and finds the ones that have the most occurrences. 

#!/usr/bin/env python3
#enter user to iput integers and split the list 
num = list(map(int, input("Enter integers sepearated by a space: ").split()))
#dictionary
occured = {}
#set a counter
maxcount = 0

#for loop to add to max mount when a number is not occured,
#reassigns the max  count if a count exceeds the max count
for x in num:
        if x not in occured.keys():
            occured[x] = num.count(x)
            if occured[x]>maxcount:
                maxcount = occured[x]
print("Numbers that have the most occurences: ")
#for loop that shows all the max counted variables
for x in occured.keys():
    if occured[x] == maxcount:
        print(x, end=" ")

vowels=0
consonants=0

#askes the user to input a sentence converts it to lowercase for continuity 
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ").lower()     

#loop checks each element in the string
#if an element fits the criteria of a vowel adds 1 to vowels
#if an element fits the criteria for a constant adds 1 to constant
for a in range(0,len(sentence)):
    if sentence[a] in ('a',"e","i","o","u"):
        vowels = vowels + 1;
      
    elif (sentence[a] >= 'a' and sentence[a] <= 'z'):
        consonants = consonants + 1;

#print out the vowels and constants
print("Vowels occured:", vowels)
print("Consonants occured:", consonants)
